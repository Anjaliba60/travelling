<h1> Travelling and its advantages</h1>
<p>What comes to your mind when someone asks you about “travel”? 
Does travel mean a vacation on the beach while sipping some margaritas, 
an adventure to the unknown, or an Instagrammable sunset destination? 
The idea of travelling varies 
from person to person, but the advantages of travelling are unbounded. 
When you travel, not the trip or the vacation itself, but the whole process of
 planning, exploring, and returning from a trip is important.
 When you realise how the benefits of travelling can do wonders for you, you 
definitely will have the motivation to pack your bag and start travelling more.</P>

<p>Improving your well-being is one of the fundamental benefits of travelling.
 Travelling helps to decrease the risks of heart attack and anxiety, while developing 
our brain health.
One of the health benefits of travelling is that when you travel
 to new surroundings, you press a restart button to your body and mind, 
which brings in fresh energy when you get back to your regular activities. 
It keeps you physically fit by being active on the journey, exploring nature, hiking, 
or strolling the local markets. A healthy body means a healthy mind, and the 
stimulation you get from travelling can boost your productivity and effectiveness
 in your daily work. </p>

<p>Some people enjoy the idea of travelling because it allows 
them to meet new people from all walks of life. Speaking to new people and 
getting new perspectives will change how one perceives the world and easily 
get engaged in various topics of conversation. </p>

<p>
Travelling is more than just about exploring new places. 
It also allows you to become more tolerant and open towards new cultures and people. 
It is a great opportunity to connect with locals and other like-minded people from 
around the globe. When you are willing to strike up a conversation with someone from a 
different background, the more you understand them and accept diversity, the better 
your tolerance level gets. Travelling teaches us to appreciate and value cultural
 diversity, traditions and appearances. </p>

<p>
If you travel in a big group, special memories from the trip can be turned
 into engaging stories that can last for a lifetime. When we travel, we are 
relaxed and open to show our true colors, which even adds more spices to the fun. 
This is the reason why travelling can be such a great bonding activity for 
families or groups of friends.</p>
